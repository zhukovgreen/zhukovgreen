# Experience

**System Architect | Machine learning engineer | Software team leader at Remak**

Dates Employed Aug 2017 – Jan 2020

Employment Duration 2 yrs 6 mos

Building a software platform to support new products and the company's processes.
- leading the team of 4 developers, learning from them
- determining backend architecture and technological stack
- building microservices (Python, aiohttp, Docker, openAPI ...)
- setting up CI pipelines for microservice unit and integrational tests and 
deployment to the staging server
- setting up app monitoring
