Hello, my name is Artem Zhukov,

I am Python Software engineer with big love to modern python, concurrency and
static typing.

Interesting in building web applications, ml models, cli tools, python asyncio,
python data typing, dev-ops, ml-ops, etc.

  Linux and Mono, Linux with wine integration to run windows assemblies on
  Linux
  )
- Building infrastructure automation for development and staging environments
- Setting up app monitoring with the help of Gitlab CI, Sentry, and some scripting
- Setting up app templating, pre-commit hooks for a team

**Machine learning engineer:**
