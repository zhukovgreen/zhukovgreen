# BIO

Artem graduated in 2008 from Donbas National Academy of Civil Engineering with
master degree in mechanical engineering.

Being always a software engineer and mathematician by heart it took 8 years 
though to transition to the world of software development.

In 2016 Artem started a project where quickly migrated from the product owner
role into the team lead and software developer. With extensive educational 
program in computer science, machine learning and python programming language,
in 2019, Artem were able to work independently as a software engineer. 
In 2020, with a help of his team, he was creating architectures for all 
software company products and implemented them together with his team.

In 2021, Artem completely converged into Python Software engineer 
with the passion to modern Python3, concurrency and typing.

Interested in software architectures, data engineering, web applications, 
ml architectures, cli tools, dev-ops, ml-ops, ci etc.

He is always learning and applying.

# Experience

## Data Engineer at Absa

Dates Employed Aug 2021 - present

## Senior Software Engineer at Redhat

Dates Employed Jul 2021 - Aug 2021

Working in the Convert2RHEL team. Designing the simple, but specific and reach
CI system for developing and running integration tests 
(libvirt, ansible, testing farm, tmt). 
Developing new features in the upstream project, code review. Adopting pytest,
transition the app to python3, mentoring.

A note from the promotion document:

```
Artem joined Red Hat during the spring of 2020 as a software developer working on the LEAPP team. 
Artem’s enthusiasm for Python and pythonic development practices soon led him to adopt an advocacy role on his team. 
Artem transitioned to the Convert2RHEL team in early 2021, and rapidly became one of the team’s most 
prolific contributors. He continued to broaden his reach beyond his SST by creating a hardware deprecation database 
and associated microservice which helps to take the mystery out of hardware support. 
Artem’s creativity and energy have made him a true asset to his teams.
```
