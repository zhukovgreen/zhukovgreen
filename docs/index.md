# BIO

I am a software and data engineer who started a professional IT career in 2016.
Within data engineering, I have good experience working with
Apache Spark, Delta Lake, and Databricks as a platform. I also love and use
functional programming in most of my projects;
Python's mypy, software architectures, distributed systems, and
concurrent programming. My main language is Python, but also I work in Scala.

I had various and very different experience with building Data Lakes
(primary Databricks or Delta Lake on hdfs), ELT pipelines, Testing tools,
CI/CD systems, clouds (mostly AWS), RHEL, Centos.

I am big advocate for software testing. Generally, I am working on solving
complex problems, building system architectures and frameworks.

My last three projects are used by many people and keep evolving even if I
dropped maintaining them.

I prefer reading books and get a deep understanding of technologies.

# Examples of my work

<img src="https://ghchart.rshah.org/zhukovgreen"/>

I am maintaining multiple OSS projects and the latest OSS project
I've built is
pramen-py <https://github.com/AbsaOSS/pramen/tree/main/pramen-py>.
This is a framework enabling a convenient way to define spark transformations
pipelines.

One other project that addresses the testing convenience is
<https://github.com/zhukovgreen/pytest-when>

But one of my favorite which is small but very powerful is
<https://github.com/zhukovgreen/friendly-sequences>. This is type-safe library
for functions chaining.

Within Paylocity I built many interesting frameworks for the data quality
systems, feature store and declarative schema evolution framework, new CI/CD
system and many other interesting and useful projects.

transition the app to python3, mentoring.

A note from the promotion document:

```
Artem joined Red Hat during the spring of 2020 as a software developer working on
the LEAPP team. Artem’s enthusiasm for Python and pythonic development practices 
soon led him to adopt an advocacy role on his team. 
Artem transitioned to the Convert2RHEL team in early 2021, and rapidly became one
of the team’s most prolific contributors. He continued to broaden his reach beyond 
his SST by creating a hardware deprecation database and associated microservice 
which helps to take the mystery out of hardware support. 
Artem’s creativity and energy have made him a true asset to his teams.
