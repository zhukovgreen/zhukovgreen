# BIO

I am a software and data engineer, started a professional IT carrier in 2016.
Within the data engineering, at the time of writing, I mostly like working
with Apache Spark when working with the data. I also love and use functional programming,
python's mypy, software architectures, distributed systems and python's asyncio.

I am writing tests before the implementation. And I am terrible in quick and dirty
tasks. My last three projects are used by many people and keep evolving even if I
dropped maintaining them.

I had various and very different experience with the CI/CD systems and clouds, building
and maintaining various on-prem systems as well as systems built on top of AWS.

I am giving talks in various conferences and at the time of writing the most significant is:
DevConf.US (<http://DevConf.US>) 2021 - Framework for integration tests lifecycle
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7VcLnHRz0w&list=PLU1vS0speL2ZbTPg-aU2Rw2s6IPsTVoCF&index=60>.
Also participating in python/data meetups.

I am maintaining multiple OSS projects, and the latest project
I've built is pramen-py <https://github.com/AbsaOSS/pramen/tree/main/pramen-py>.
I think it is awesome project and I am using it quite often.

A note from the promotion document:

```
Artem joined Red Hat during the spring of 2020 as a software developer working on
the LEAPP team. Artem’s enthusiasm for Python and pythonic development practices 
soon led him to adopt an advocacy role on his team. 
Artem transitioned to the Convert2RHEL team in early 2021, and rapidly became one
of the team’s most prolific contributors. He continued to broaden his reach beyond 
his SST by creating a hardware deprecation database and associated microservice 
which helps to take the mystery out of hardware support. 
Artem’s creativity and energy have made him a true asset to his teams.
