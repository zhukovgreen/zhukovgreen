# Free time

I contribute to open-source projects (i.e.
    <https://github.com/cr0hn/aiohttp-cache>,
    <https://github.com/webknjaz/docker-freecad-cli>,
), writing telegram bots (i.e.
    <https://github.com/ZhukovGreen/gcal_time_track_tg_bot>,
), testing different neural nets architectures and learning new things.

And participating in a variety of meetups and conferences.
