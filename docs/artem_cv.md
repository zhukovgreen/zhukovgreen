Software engineer and machine learning engineer with more than 4 years of 
experience.

Interested in web applications, DevOps, infrastructure automation, and 
bots. Compliment projects with machine learning, growing as a professional,
learning new technologies, experimenting and building interesting products.

I am pedantic in terms of writing clean and simple code, 
testing and documenting my work.

# Tech stack

- Linux operating systems
- Containerization, distributed systems, cloud computing (Docker, AWS, 
Kubernetes)
- Software development (
    `web`, `web applications`, `microservices`, `apis`, `bots`,
    `testing`, `code linting`,
)
- Backend developer (
    `python`, `asyncio`, `aiohttp`, `numpy`, `pandas`, `scipy`, `pytorch`, 
    `keras`, `scikit-learn`, `xgboost`, `opencv`, `freecad`, `aiogram`
)
- Automation (
    `CI/CD`, `Gitlab CI`, `Circle CI`, `Ansible`, `Python`, `docker-compose`,
    `Kubernetes`, `Vagrant`,
)
- Other tools (
    `shell scripting`, `git`, `docker`, `gitlab`, `postgresql`, `redis`, 
    `celery`, `openapi`,`swagger`, `pre-commit`
)
- `vim`, `vim scripting`

# Free time

I contribute to open-source projects (i.e. 
    <https://github.com/cr0hn/aiohttp-cache>, 
    <https://github.com/webknjaz/docker-freecad-cli>,
), writing telegram bots (i.e. 
    <https://github.com/ZhukovGreen/gcal_time_track_tg_bot>,
), testing different neural nets architectures and learning new things. 

# Experience

## System Architect | Machine learning engineer | Software team leader at Remak

Dates Employed Jan 2016 – Jan 2020

Employment Duration 4 yrs 1 mos

Building a software platform to support new products and company processes.


**Team leadership:**
- leading the team of 4 developers, learning from them
- specified sprint epics, controlling team progress, reporting to the client
- determining backend architecture and technological stack

**Software developer:**
- building async microservices (Python, aiohttp, Docker, openAPI ...)
    - with the normal pythonic worker
    - where the worker was a CDLL of .NET assembly and applied 
    different approaches in parallelization
    - numeric microservices where the main worker was a numpy or pytorch model
    - Automate the openAPI spec definition with the help of swagger, attrs, 
    marshmallow etc.
- unit, integration and load testing
    - primary with the pytest
    - API mocking
    - integration testing for microservices based application
- documentation and code review
- setting up CI pipelines for linting, testing, and building images

**DevOps:**
- Setting up automatic deployment system with the help of Gitlab runners,
docker-compose, shell scripting, and Gitlab CI.
- Writing Ansible and Vagrant scripts to deploy the app on Kubernetes
- Containerization of different applications for the needs of the team (
    i.e. special cli version of FreeCAD, the image with pythonnet support on
    Linux and Mono, linux with wine integration to run windows assemblies on 
    linux
)
- Building infrastructure automation for development and staging environments
- Setting up app monitoring with the help of Gitlab CI, Sentry and some scripting
- Setting up app templating, pre-commit hooks for a team

**Machine learning engineer:**
- applying machine learning to improve user experience. 
    - Particularly speeding up the calculation processes
    - Supervise learning, mostly with gradient boosting and partly with the 
    combination of neural nets in PyTorch
    - applying optimization with evolutionary algorithms (SciPy + PyTorch)
