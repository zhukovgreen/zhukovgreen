    - with the normal pythonic worker
    - where the worker was a CDLL of .NET assembly and applied
    different approaches in parallelization
    - numeric microservices where the main worker was a numpy or pytorch model
    - Automate the openAPI spec definition with the help of swagger, attrs,
    marshmallow etc.
- unit, integration, and load testing
    - primary with the pytest
    - API mocking
    - integration testing for microservices-based application
- documentation and code review
- setting up CI pipelines for linting, testing, and building images

- Setting up automatic deployment system with the help of Gitlab runners,
docker-compose, shell scripting, and Gitlab CI.
- Writing Ansible and Vagrant scripts to deploy the app on Kubernetes
- Containerization of different applications for the needs of the team (
    i.e. special cli version of FreeCAD, the image with pythonnet support on
    Linux and Mono, Linux with wine integration to run windows assemblies on
    Linux
)
- Building infrastructure automation for development and staging environments
- Setting up app monitoring with the help of Gitlab CI, Sentry, and some scripting
- Setting up app templating, pre-commit hooks for a team

**Machine learning engineer:**
- applying machine learning to improve user experience.
    - Particularly speeding up the calculation processes
