# My Databricks experience

Participating in designing new ELT architectures in two companies. In total
I have experience building and using three different databricks architectures,
one of which implements Databricks medallion architecture.

Quite extensive experience with the:
- Databricks API
- Pulumi Databricks plugin
- Databricks feature store
- Databricks Unity Catalog.
This inspired me to build own feature store and give a talk about it
on the PyCon CZ 2023 <https://cz.pycon.org/2023/program/talks/65/>
- Delta live tables and Workflows
- Databrics Medallion architecture and various ways to implement it
- Data quality, lineage, and access management
- Data streaming for near real time data processing
- Spark jobs optimization, data pulling/pushing to the RDBMS etc.
- Building tools around Databricks components to simplify Data Scientists
